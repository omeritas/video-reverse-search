# Video Reverse Search Engine (unfinished)

The video reverse search Python script does the following:
1. Extract the frames from the specified video
2. Uses skimage to save unique frames by avoiding similar looking frames
3. Reverse searches all frames using Yandex Image Reverse Search Engine
4. The proxies must be defined in the proxies list to go through all frames 
5. The proxies scrape the URLs/images from the Yandex results of the frames
